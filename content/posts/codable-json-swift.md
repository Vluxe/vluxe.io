We are back! Wow has it really been two years? Ironically our last post was celebrating the one year mark with new things to come and then... radio silence.

Alas, we missed y'all and are back with a fresh new design and content. This week I wanted to cover Swift 4's `Codable` protocol. I know, I can hear your groans now about another `Codable` article, but I wanted to use this article to showcase `Codable` in a practical HTTP API setting. Plus it gives me the excuse to show off the new version 3 of [SwiftHTTP](https://github.com/daltoniam/SwiftHTTP) and to officially deprecate [JSONJoy](https://github.com/daltoniam/JSONJoy-Swift) (Apple decided to create even more joy, lame pun intended).

First off, if you want a great technical explanation of the `Codable` protocol, please check out Mike Ash's wonderful [post](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-07-14-swiftcodable.html). I am going to focus on high level details with examples to drive home the point. Without any further ramblings, example time!


 Let's write a quick web server in Go (because we like Go and it gives us a full example to work with).

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/bar", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		log.Println("got a web request")
		w.Write([]byte("{\"status\": \"ok\"}"))
	})

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

That code is fairly straight forward. Any request received sends back some JSON that says "OK". Now onto the Swift!

We create a struct that implements the `Codable` protocol.

```swift
struct Response: Codable {
    let status: String
}
```

That's it! This will handle most cases and should create our model off those properties. Now let's hook this up to our SwiftHTTP web request.

```swift
HTTP.GET("http://localhost:8080/bar") { response in
    if let error = response.error {
        print("got an error: \(error)")
        return
    }
    do {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        let resp = try decoder.decode(Response.self, from: response.data)
        print("completed: \(resp.status)")
    } catch let error {
        print("decode json error: \(error)")
    }
}
``` 
Now I'm sure you have questions about some of the edge cases JSON parsing presents with this simple example. You are probably thinking: "what about handling JSON's snake case vs Swift's camel case"? "How do I handle arrays"? "What about side loaded models?" "how about dates"? I said this article was practical, didn't I? We have examples for all those cases below. Actually, stacks and stacks of examples. OK, OK, only four of them, but enjoy them none the less!

### Casing

Now let's say we have some JSON that has the typical snake case.

```javascript
{
    "id" : 1,
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "age": 25
}

```

Here is our corresponding Swift model that uses camel case.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
    let age: Int
}
```

These properties unfortunately don't map since their names are different. We could name just change our Swift (or JSON) properties to match, but that looks ugly and feels awkward when everything else is camel cased in Swift. We can easily fix that by changing our Swift model to include:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
    let age: Int
    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case firstName = "first_name"
        case lastName = "last_name"
        case age
    }
}
```

That takes care of that. Now we can keep our code looking consistent and pretty. The main caveat here is we have to include _all_ of our properties names in the `CodingKeys` enum even if we only need to change one property mapping. 

### Arrays

The good news is parsing Array's is very straight forward. Take the JSON from this API: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos). If you are too lazy to click or tap that link here is an example:

```javascript
[
  {
    "albumId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "accusamus beatae ad facilis cum similique qui sunt",
    "url": "http://placehold.it/600/92c952",
    "thumbnailUrl": "http://placehold.it/150/92c952"
  },
  {
    "albumId": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "title": "reprehenderit est deserunt velit ipsam",
    "url": "http://placehold.it/600/771796",
    "thumbnailUrl": "http://placehold.it/150/771796"
  },
  /*...... 4998 more photos in the array.... */
```

The model:

```swift
struct Photo: Codable {
    let albumId: Int
    let id: Int
    let title: String
    let url: String
    let thumbnailUrl: String
}
```


```swift
HTTP.GET("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos") { (response) in
    if let error = response.error {
        print("got an error: \(error)")
        return
    }
    let decoder = JSONDecoder()
    do {
        let photos = try decoder.decode([Photo].self, from: response.data) //notice the array brackets [] around the Photo model
        for photo in photos {
            print("photo id: \(photo.id) url: \(photo.url)")
        }
    } catch let error {
        print("got an error: \(error)")
    }
}
``` 
Easy right? You throw some brackets in there and are good to go.

### Date

I included this one because I was able to take it directly from the WWDC slides. I regret nothing.

```javascript
{
  "name": "Monalisa Octocat",
  "email": "support@github.com",
  "date": "2011-04-14T16:00:49Z"
}
```

Swift model:

```swift
struct Author : Codable {
  let name: String
  let email: String
  let date: Date
}
```


```swift
HTTP.GET("http://localhost:8080/author") { response in
    if let error = response.error {
        print("got an error: \(error)")
        return
    }
    do {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        decoder.dateDecodingStrategy = .iso8601 //It will properly map the JSON string to the Date object since it knows the format
        let author = try decoder.decode(Author.self, from: response.data)
        print("date: \(author.date)")
    } catch let error {
        print("decode json error: \(error)")
    }
}
``` 

The default for `dateDecodingStrategy` is `deferredToDate`. The [docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonencoder.dateencodingstrategy/2895359-deferredtodate) says this means: `The strategy that uses formatting from the Date structure`. Not super helpful in our case without having a `Date` structure yet, but at least we can easily change it to a fairly standard `iso8601` with a simple property change.

### Side loaded models

We can bring it all home with some side loaded models. 

```javascript
{
	"status": "success",
	"users": [{
		"id": 1,
		"first_name": "Dalton",
		"last_name": "Cherry"
	}, {
		"id": 2,
		"first_name": "Austin",
		"last_name": "Cherry"
	}],
	"user": {
		"id": 3,
		"first_name": "John",
		"last_name": "Doe"
	}
}
```

The models:

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let firstName: String
    let lastName: String
    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case firstName = "first_name"
        case lastName = "last_name"
        case age
    }
}

struct Response: Codable {
    let status: String
    let users: [User]
    let user: User
}
```

And... the request:

```swift
HTTP.GET("http://localhost:8080/bar") { response in
    if let error = response.error {
        print("got an error: \(error)")
        return
    }
    do {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        let resp = try decoder.decode(Response.self, from: response.data)
        print("completed: \(resp.status)")
        for user in resp.users {
            print("id: \(user.id) name: \(user.firstName) \(user.lastName) age: \(user.age)")
        }
        print("single user: \(resp.user.id) name: \(resp.user.firstName) \(resp.user.lastName) age: \(resp.user.age)")
        print("completed: \(resp.status)")
    } catch let error {
        print("decode json error: \(error)")
    }
}
``` 
Fairly anticlimactic for the last example, but it does showcase how easy it is to implement `Codable`. 

### End

I'm quite excited about the `Codable` protocol and the fact that it eliminate tons of boilerplate with JSON parsing in Swift. I'm also thrilled to be blogging again and we are going to try and keep the momentum going. Austin has some fun Go things coming up next to keep the content flowing with the hope for a bi-weekly schedule. If you want to stay in the loop, go [follow](https://twitter.com/vluxeio) the Vluxe twitter account (or in Youtuber terms... SHARE, LIKE, AND SUBSCRIBE). We will talk (write?) to y'all soon.
