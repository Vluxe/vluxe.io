JSON is all the rage nowadays. It seems every major SaaS, framework, and language supports JSON and Objective-C is no exception. [Programmable Web](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/1-in-5-apis-say-bye-xml/) reported in 2011 that 1 in 5 new APIs are designed with JSON only.

Fast forward to 2014, clearly JSON has become the dominant format. NSJSONSerialization gives us a great start, yet still a lot of boilerplate can go into creating and mapping JSON to proper objects. Let's take this JSON as an example

```js
{
    "id" : 1
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "age": 25,
    "address": {
        "id": 1
        "street_address": "21 2nd Street",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "postal_code": 10021
     }

}
```

Now we would want to map this to a model class to the tune of:

```objc

@interface Address : NSObject

@property(nonatomic,strong)NSNumber *objID;
@property(nonatomic,copy)NSString *streetAddress;
@property(nonatomic,copy)NSString *city;
@property(nonatomic,copy)NSString *state;
@property(nonatomic,strong)NSNumber *postalCode;

@end

@interface User : NSObject

@property(nonatomic,strong)NSNumber *objID;
@property(nonatomic,copy)NSString *firstName;
@property(nonatomic,copy)NSString *lastName;
@property(nonatomic,strong)NSNumber *age;
@property(nonatomic,strong)Address *address;

@end

```

Now a common way to accomplish this would be with boilerplate:

```objective-c

//data is a NSData version of our JSON string above.
NSError *error = nil;
NSDictionary* response = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:0 error:&error];
User *john = [[User alloc] init];
john.objID = response[@"id"];
john.firstName = response[@"first_name"];
john.lastName = response[@"last_name"];
john.age = response[@"age"];
//now for the address
john.address = [[Address alloc] init];
NSDictionary* address = response[@"address"];
john.address.objID = address[@"id"];
john.address.streetAddress = address[@"street_address"];
john.address.city = address[@"city"];
john.address.state = address[@"state"];
john.address.postalCode = address[@"postal_code"];

```

that is a **lot** of boilerplate and error prone due to the key value access of the dictionary. Thanks to the dynamic runtime we can eliminate this completely. First, we need to get the properties of the `User` object to know which JSON keys we need to map to the `User` object's properties.

```objective-c
//need to import to do some runtime work
#import <objc/runtime.h>

-(NSArray*)getPropertiesOfClass:(Class)objectClass
{
    unsigned int outCount, i;
    objc_property_t *properties = class_copyPropertyList(objectClass, &outCount);
    NSMutableArray *gather = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:outCount];
    for(i = 0; i < outCount; i++)
    {
        objc_property_t property = properties[i];
        NSString* propName = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:property_getName(property)];
        const char *type = property_getAttributes(property);

        NSString *typeString = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:type];
        NSArray *attributes = [typeString componentsSeparatedByString:@","];
        NSString *typeAttribute = [attributes objectAtIndex:0];

        if ([typeAttribute hasPrefix:@"T@"] && [typeAttribute length] > 3)
        {
            NSString * typeClassName = [typeAttribute substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(3, [typeAttribute length]-4)];  //turns @"NSDate" into NSDate
            Class typeClass = NSClassFromString(typeClassName);
            if(!self.propertyClasses)
                self.propertyClasses = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
            [self.propertyClasses setObject:typeClass forKey:propName];
        }
        [gather addObject:propName];
    }
    free(properties);
    if([objectClass superclass] && [objectClass superclass] != [NSObject class])
        [gather addObjectsFromArray:[self getPropertiesOfClass:[objectClass superclass]]];
    return gather;
}
```

Let's break down what is happening. Objective-C is a dynamic language as previously mentioned. This differs from more common languages like C++ or Java. We could spend a whole article (and probably will) on the differences between dynamic and static languages, but for now let's just settle on a 10,000 foot explanation. A dynamic language is where method execution is done at runtime. This means a method does not technically have to exist before we start running the application. Due to this design, we get a lot of power to easily inspect the object at runtime and find its properties. If you want to learn more about the runtime, [Mark Dalrymple](https://twitter.com/borkware) at [Big Nerd Ranch](http://bignerdranch.com) has a great set of [articles](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/2833-inside-the-bracket-part-1-open-for-business/) that explain this subject in depth.

Now for the code, `objc_property_t` is a C structure, which the comments define as
```objective-c
An opaque type that represents an Objective-C declared property.
```
`class_copyPropertyList` returns a C array of these structures. Next, we iterate over them with a standard `for` loop and process each structure in the array. First, we get the name of the property via `property_getName`. Next, we pull the attributes of the property via `property_getAttributes` and separate them out to get the ones we want. We are primarily interested in the first attribute which we can use to get the class of the property. Using `NSClassFromString` we can convert the string name of the class into the class representation. Lastly, we clean up our C array with `free()` and check if we need to get our super class' properties.

Ok great, now we have both the property names and their classes. Let's take a look at our list

```objective-c
objID =  NSNumber
firstName = NSString
lastName = NSString
age = NSNumber
address = Address
```

armed with this information we can easily map the JSON object to our `User` object and even validate that our property classes are the expected types from the JSON. The only thing left we need to do is match the different naming conventions of JSON and Objective-C. This means converting the camel casing of Objective-C to the snake casing of JSON. That can be accomplished like so

```objective-c
+(NSString*)convertToJsonName:(NSString*)propName start:(NSInteger)start
{
    NSRange range = [propName rangeOfString:@"[a-z.-][^a-z .-]" options:NSRegularExpressionSearch range:NSMakeRange(start, propName.length-start)];
    if(range.location != NSNotFound && range.location < propName.length)
    {
        unichar c = [propName characterAtIndex:range.location+1];
        propName = [propName stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%c",c]
                                                       withString:[[NSString stringWithFormat:@"_%c",c] lowercaseString]
                                                          options:0 range:NSMakeRange(start, propName.length-start)];
        return [self convertToJsonName:propName start:range.location+1];
    }
    return propName;
}
```

This method takes our property name of `firstName` and converts it to `first_name` so that when we search in the NSDictonary returned from NSJSONSerialization, we will find the correct key name. After that it is a simple loop to get the values matched up

```objective-c
User *john = [[User alloc] init];
for(NSString* propName in propArray) //propArray is a NSArray of our property names
{
  NSString* jsonName = [self convertToJsonName:propName];
  id value = jsonDict[jsonName];
  [john setValue:value forKey:propName];
}
```

much better. All we had to do, was loop through our property array and convert the property name to the JSON style name and use \*KVC to set the property's value. The boilerplate has been eliminated and our code is now much less error prone. This example left out how to get the child object(address), but that is fairly straight forward with a little recursion. If you are interested in seeing that implementation I wrote a library. You can check out [JSONJoy here](https://github.com/daltoniam/JSONJoy). Using JSONJoy with the same example from above, we can shorten the parsing to a single line.

```objective-c
//responseObject is a NSDictonary from NSJSONSerialization or a NSString of the JSON string.
User *john = [User objectWithJoy:responseObject];
//JSON is fully parsed and mapped to our john User object.
```

Objective-C is not the only language with a dynamic runtime and I would be interested in seeing this same implementation in other languages. If you run across one or create one, please let me know. Using Objective-C with a bit of creativity and its powerful dynamic runtime, we can take a common, mundane, and error prone task, and turn it into a concise and joyful experience. JSON never looked so good!
